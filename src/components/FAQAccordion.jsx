      "<span class='text-[var(--green)]'>Yes.</span> Snowflake browser is an open-source software made with Electron. You might wonder how can a web browser made with React+TS be secure? It ships with bare-bones chromium and node binaries, <span class='text-[var(--yellow)]'>BUT</span> the architecture is tweaked such that the renderer process and node integration are set to work in separate processes than that of the browser. Therefore, compiled javascript code used for the UI will not expose vulnerability to websites that you visit. <br/><br/>You can check out other Native open-source web browsers like: <a href='https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium' class='underline underline-offset-2' target='_blank'>Ungoogled Chromium</a> and FF derivatives for more features and customization.",

      "ðŸ˜… You don't have to. While Snowflake browser provides features and settings to keep your private data and identity safe on the internet, It doesn't provide all the basic features that other browsers do, for reducing fingerprinting. <br/><br/> It is meant to be used by following necessary measures according to personal use case, For Eg: <ul class='mt-4 ml-6 list-disc'><li>prevent third-party login (Google, microsoft, apple, facebook, etc)</li> <li>Using extra filter lists</li> <li>Handle website permissions</li> <li>Using proxy/VPN/TOR (optional)</li> <li>Harden browser settings</li></ul>",

It does not provide some features that normal browsers provide in order to keep users' data private and secure. Chrome/FF extensions cannot to be installed for privacy protection. You should use it where and when needed like <a href='https://www.torproject.org/' class='underline underline-offset-2' target='_blank'>TOR</a>.<br/><br/>If you still need to use it as daily driver for it's features, I'd recommend to use third-party open-source password manager, download manager, proxy/VPN (optional), etc for daily use case.",

Resist Fingerprinting option injects script (if javascript is enabled) to spoof fingerprintable properties and randomization for WebRTC, Canvas, WebGL, etc to protect users from being tracked. <br/><br/> Though it swaps most common properties to make user blend-in with traffic, It should score 8/10 for fingerprint resistance by default. You can turn off persistent session to make browser <span class='italic'>'forget'</span> everything once the window is closed.",
